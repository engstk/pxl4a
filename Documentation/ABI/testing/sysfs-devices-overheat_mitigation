Contact:	"Maggie White" <maggiewhite@google.com>
Description:
		Number of seconds from USB charger plug time to the time that
                the overheat threshold for the USB port temperature is tripped.

What:		/sys/devices/platform/soc/soc:google,overheat_mitigation/hysteresis_time
Date:		February, 2019
Contact:	"Maggie White" <maggiewhite@google.com>
Description:
		Number of seconds from the time that the overheat threshold for
                the USB port temperature is tripped until the hysteresis
                threshold for the USB port temperature is cleared.

Description:
                Number of sections from the time that the hysteresis threshold
                for the USB port temperature is cleared until the charger is
                unplugged from the device, therefore clearing the active
                overheat mitigation.
