Snapdragon Display Engine Lease registers with the Linux DRM/KMS framework to
facilitate DRM driver creation, publishing /dev/dri/card<n>, n=1,2,... from
card0 with objects implicitly leased.

- compatible: Must be "qcom,sde-kms-lease".
- qcom,lease-connectors: Connector names leased to the card.
- qcom,lease-planes: Plane names leased to the card.

Optional properties
- qcom,dev-name: Name of the lease device.

Example:
	card1: qcom,sde-kms-lease@0 {
		compatible = "qcom,sde-kms-lease";
		qcom,dev-name = "msm_drm1";
		qcom,lease-connectors = "DSI-1";
		qcom,lease-planes = "plane-0", "plane-8";
	};

	card2: qcom,sde-kms-lease@1 {
		compatible = "qcom,sde-kms-lease";
		qcom,dev-name = "msm_drm2";
		qcom,lease-connectors = "DSI-2";
		qcom,lease-planes = "plane-1", "plane-9";
	};
