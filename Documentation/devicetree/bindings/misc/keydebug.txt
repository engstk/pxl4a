keydebug driver
=========================

When a system is locked up and unresponsive, a user may long press key to force
reset it. keydebug driver add debug function to collect more information in this
path before system restart.

Collects:
-Top CPU usage tasks
-Call stack of uninterruptible tasks
-Call stack of each online core

Required properties:
- compatible:     must be "keydebug"

- keys_down:      The input key-code used to active debug function count down.
- key_down_delay: The time the input key need to be hold to trigger debug
                  event, value is in milliseconds.
- dbg_fn_delay:   The delay time to active debug function, value is in
                  milliseconds.
Example:
	keydebug {
		compatible = "keydebug";
		key_down_delay = <7000>;
		keys_down = <116>;
		dbg_fn_delay = <2500>;
	}
