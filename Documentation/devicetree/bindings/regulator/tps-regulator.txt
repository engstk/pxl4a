TPS fixed voltage regulators

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "regulator-tps".
- nr-control-gpios: the number of gpios involved in controlling the
  regulator.
- control-gpios: list of phandles for the control gpio.
- gpio-enable-sequence - gpio indexes for enabling the regulator.
- gpio-enable-delay - delays in microseconds, if any, after turning on
  each gpio in gpio-enable-sequence. 0 if no delay.
- gpio-disable-sequence - gpio indexes for disabling the regulator.
- gpio-disable-delay - delays in microseconds, if any, after turning off
  each gpio in gpio-disable-sequence. 0 if no delay.

Any property defined as part of the core regulator
binding, defined in regulator.txt, can also be used.
However a fixed voltage regulator is expected to have the
regulator-min-microvolt and regulator-max-microvolt
to be the same.

Example:
        regulator@00{
                compatible = "regulator-tps";
                regulator-name = "ext_5v_boost";
                nr-control-gpios = <3>;
                control-gpios = <&tlmm 146 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>,
                                <&tlmm 66 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>,
                                <&tlmm 118 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
                gpio-enable-sequence = <1 2 3>;
                gpio-enable-delay = <1000 100 300>;
                gpio-disable-sequence = <2 3 1>;
                gpio-disable-delay = <0 0 0>;
                status = "okay";
        };
